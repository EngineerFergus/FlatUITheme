# Graphical User Interfaces
Interfaces are important. They represent the points where two systems, entities, subjects, organizations, etc meet and interact. If an interface is terrible, whatever systems are interacting through that interface become unusable. Sadly, as a software engineer who mainly works on hardware control, data processing, databases, and everything on the backend of an application, I often find myself allowing the user interface to suffer from neglect. I will cobble together something that works reasonably well, then move on. My general work day also does not allow for much time to be spent learning how to create captivating, beautiful, or user friendly interfaces for the people that use our team's software. As such, this project is solely focused on forcing myself to learn XAML within the .Net ecosystem for user interface development. I often overlook the complexity that can go into making a good user interface, so my plan is devote time to learning this side of software development so that I can more quickly draw on these experiences in the future.
